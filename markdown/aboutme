Tim Henderson - Co-Founder
--------------------------

Tim is a computer science student at Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio. He enjoys working on complex systems and has lately taken an interest in database implementations. As a Python developer for the last 8 years Tim has gained experience in many things including webapps, scientific computing, desktop apps, encryption, object relational mappers, and version control internals. While Python has been a language of choice for sometime, he also has worked in C# (XNA games and WPF desktop apps), Java (algorithms and a basic cgi web app), and most recently Google Go (top down predictive parser, filestructures, and graph algorithms).

For a look at some open source code he has released check out his <a href="http://github.com/timtadh/">github</a> or visit his slowly growing <a href="http://blog.hackthology.com">blog</a> for more up to date information on his current interests.
