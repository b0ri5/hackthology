I find this comment thread on how programmers will "automate" our way out of
jobs to be especially pertinent as I work on my proposal. A contention I have,
as do many others, is the primary practical challenge standing between us and
robust systems is complexity. There are several on this thread who believe we
have essentially mastered complexity for a broad number important application
areas.

I think I could be convinced of this argument as long as those application areas
are very narrow. As long as the creators of those applications are content with
relatively standardized solutions. The moment there are A) functional
requirements not covered by the standard case or B) differentiating requirements
(such as aesthetics etc...) the general tool stops working. This is what makes
complexity such a beast.  If you make a fully generic tool, you have created a
programming language. Perhaps a very high level (even graphical language like
LabView) but still a language. Such things require trained people to operate.

We will never not need programmers.
