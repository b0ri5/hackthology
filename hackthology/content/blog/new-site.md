It has been 6 months maybe more since Posterous shut down and I have just now
gotten around to recreating my site. I chose to do this on github pages with
pelican. Hosting on github is easy and simple. If github every stops doing these
pages I can easily self host. I have now ported most of my old posts thanks to
`pandoc`. The posts I left behind were mostly terrible so all in all I think the
new site is a big improvement. I might even write some more posts.
