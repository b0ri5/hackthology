Last night I gave a talk at CWRU Hacker Society about formal languages.
This is the first talk in a series of lectures I will be giving on
compilers. Unfortunately, unlike my regular expression talk I did not
get a recording of the audio. I may do a write up of exactly what I
talked about later. Until then enjoy my "slides."
