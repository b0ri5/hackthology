Dr. Smil is right about education. We cannot "innovate" our way out of poor
educational policy - which is intimately tied up with many of our other
policies. The Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) is the new textbook not the new
classroom. The motivated student could always visit the library. These courses
make material more accessible but the classroom is where the student is not
where the material is. Not every person who needs help will be able to seek it.
To help them you first have to find them, they will not find you.
