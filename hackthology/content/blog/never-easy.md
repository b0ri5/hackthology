Dijkstra, in the essay, felt that at the current moment in time (1972) the
programmer was limited by the tools. That their thought processes were limited
by poor languages and poor environment. However, he expressed great hope that
this was transitory. Our tools would improve but he warns:

I believe he was right. Some might argue are tools have not improved and that is
why programming is not better. Indeed they may say it is worse than ever. But, I
think our tools have improved. They don't always improve linearly but they are
improving in fits and starts, with steps forwards and steps back. No matter how
much our tools may have improved the state of programming as a practice has
barely advanced at all! We still struggle against our own inadequacies, our own
failings. Even when the algorithms are clear, the problem well studied, the
programmer rarely gets it right the first time. Programming doesn't get easier
as the tools get better. Rather the scope of our ambition climbs. As it climbs
the problems get harder and the tried and true solution of yesteryear seems
quaint to the practicing programmer of today.

So, we cannot rest on our laurels. We must strive on and construct new tools
which ease our current pains, even if inevitably new pains arise. For, in
learning, there is suffering.
