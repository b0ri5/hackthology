My name is Tim Henderson. I am a PhD Candidate at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, Ohio where I work in data mining, software engineering,
and program analysis. I help run CWRU Hacker Society and attend a number of
programming clubs in the Cleveland area. In my free time I run, hike, camp, read
and occasionally paint.
