My name is Tim Henderson. I am a PhD Candidate at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, Ohio where I am researching how to improve static
program analysis by inferencing system specific static analysis rules. I help
run CWRU Hacker Society and attend a number of programming clubs in the
Cleveland area. In my free time I run, hike, camp, read and occasionally paint.

I love working in Python, Go, and a number of other languages. If you would like
my assistance on a project of mutual interest don't hesitate to email me.
