I available for consulting on a per project basis. I can also offer training
materials and sessions on a number of topics.


# Parsing

Do you have a complex language which needs to be parsed? Don't have the in house
skill set or the time? Then let's work together on your parsing problem! I have
written many parsers from scratch as well as implemented regular expression
engines and general parsing frameworks. Contracts are negotiated on a per
project basis depending on the complexity of the project.

## Training

I also have a variety of training materials ready to help your developers get up
to speed on:

1. Lexical analysis with regular expressions
2. Lexical analyzer engine implementation
3. Context Free Grammars
4. Top Down Parsing
5. Table Driven Top Down Parsing
6. Bottom Up Parsing with Yacc and Yacc like systems
7. Intermediate Representations with Abstract Syntax Trees

# Python or Go Consulting

Do you have a project in Python or Go that needs some additional support? I am
your guy! I have been working in Python since 2003 and I have been working with
Go since its first public release (2009). I have implemented a number of systems
including: web services, databases, gui programs, deployment management systems,
compilers, machine learning algorithms, etc...


# Distributed Programming and Systems Programming

Need to setup a Map Reduce System? Need to write your own Map Reduce System?
Need to write your own database? Let's talk!
