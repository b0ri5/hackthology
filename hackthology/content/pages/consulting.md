I available for consulting on a per project basis. I can also offer training
materials and sessions on a number of topics. I am particularly interested in
working on projects related to compilers and programming languages. However, I
have worked on variety of other systems as well including: web services, thick
clients, databases, distributed computing, map reduce, bioinformatics, web
security, and software testing and verification.

Please get in touch at :: tadh at case dot edu, subject line should including

# Parsing

Do you have a complex language which needs to be parsed? Don't have the in house
skill set or the time? Then let's work together on your parsing problem! I have
written many parsers from scratch as well as implemented regular expression
engines and general parsing frameworks. Contracts are negotiated on a per
project basis depending on the complexity of the project.

## Training

I also have a variety of training materials ready to help your developers get up
to speed on:

1. Lexical analysis with regular expressions
2. Lexical analyzer engine implementation
3. Context Free Grammars
4. Top Down Parsing
5. Table Driven Top Down Parsing
6. Bottom Up Parsing with Yacc and Yacc like systems
7. Intermediate Representations with Abstract Syntax Trees
